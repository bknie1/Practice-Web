## Front End
### HTML
HTML is the nouns of our page. It is our subject matter, but by itself, cannot act.

#### Snippets
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

### CSS
CSS is the adjectives of our page. We can use CSS to describe our HTML and make things look cool.

#### Frameworks and Tools

[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### JavaScript
JavaScript is the verbs of our page. It's how we act on all of what we've constructed! JavaScript has implicit, immutable type data.

#### Basics
##### Primitive Data
  - Numbers: Integers, floating points, fractions; anything.
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - Null and Undefined Values
    - Null: Declared and initialized as 'nothing'.
    - Undefined: Declared, but not initialized.

##### Built in I/O Methods
  - Alert("Foobar"): Text pop up.
  - Prompt: Text box pop up.
    - e.g. var name = prompt("What is your name?")
  - Console.Log("Foobar"): Log printing.

##### Data Structures
  - Arrays
  - Objects

Simple, Non-Class, Dictionary-like Object Example
```
var person = {
  name: "Brandon",
  age: 28,
  city: "New Haven"
};
```
You can access values by name. e.g. person["name"]. Or, we can use the more typical '.' notation: person.name. However, this isn't very modular. Ideally, we create a Class Person and instantiate instances of Person using a constructor that takes the appropriate parameters.

JavaScript's new ES6 (Ecmascript 6) does support classes as we know and love them in other OO languages. However, we don't define members up front; we do it all in the constructor. This means that person can be as simple or as complex as we want.
```
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, city) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.city = city;
  }
}
```
##### The Domain Object Model (DOM)
When we use JavaScript, it interprets the entirety of our page as one big object tree. Typing 'document' yields the HTML, but typing *console.dir(document)* yields the entirety of this object tree we want to interact with.

We use selectors to discriminate between different parts of our tree.

##### Vanilla Selectors
  - getElementById, ClassName, TagName, Name
  - QuerySelector, QuerySelectorAll


#### Frameworks
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
